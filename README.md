## **Description**
This application allows the user to enter and save information into each given hour of their work day (9AM-5PM). The user can click on the input field and enter in their events and then click the save button icon to store their information locally on their browser. They can close the page or refresh it and the information will be readily available to them. If they would like to clear all of the events, there is a button at the bottom that will clear saved information from this application from their local storage. It will also update the page so that it shows all fields to be empty once again.

The time blocks are all color coded to show past(grey), present(red), and future(green) hours. This will help the user visually with being able to see where they are at in their day.
